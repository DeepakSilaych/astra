  CONTEXT-AWARE JEWELRY TRY-ON REQUEST ANALYSIS
  
  User Request: "${prompt}"
  Reference images provided: ${referenceImages.length}
  
  TASK: Extract and utilize ALL context from the user's request to inform decision-making and prompt generation for virtual jewelry try-on.
  
  DECISION FRAMEWORK - Use user request context to determine:
  1. Generate new model/person image (if no suitable person image provided OR user specifies model preferences)
  2. Generate jewelry image (if no jewelry reference provided OR user describes specific jewelry requirements)
  3. Utilize provided reference images directly
  
  COMPREHENSIVE JEWELRY CATEGORIES & CONTEXT MAPPING:
  - rings: Wedding bands, engagement rings, solitaire, eternity, statement, cocktail, signet, class rings, mood rings
    * Context extraction: Ring style, finger placement, hand pose, materials (gold/silver/platinum), gemstones, occasion
  - necklaces: Chains, chokers, statement pieces, layered styles, pearl strands, collar necklaces, lariats, rivi√®res
    * Context extraction: Chain length (choker/princess/matinee/opera), pendant presence, neckline compatibility, layering

    * Context extraction: Ear coverage, size preference, style (minimalist/statement), materials, comfort requirements
  - bracelets: Tennis, bangles, charm, cuff, link, beaded, wrap, bolo, medical alert
    * Context extraction: Wrist size, stacking preferences, bracelet width, closure type, daily wear vs special occasion
  - pendants: Lockets, charms, medallions, gemstone drops, crosses, hearts, initials, birthstones
    * Context extraction: Pendant size, personal significance, chain compatibility, symbolic meaning
  - watches: Dress, sport, dive, pilot, smartwatches, vintage, luxury, fashion watches
    * Context extraction: Use case (daily/sports/formal), band material, face size, tech features, brand preferences
  - anklets: Chain, beaded, charm, tennis, rope, slave anklets
    * Context extraction: Ankle size, style preference, beach/casual wear, layering with other accessories
  
  CONTEXT-DRIVEN MODEL PROMPT GENERATION:
  Extract and use from user request:
  - Demographics: Age range, gender identity, ethnicity (if specified)
  - Physical attributes: Skin tone, hair color/style, facial features, body type (if mentioned)
  - Style context: Professional, casual, elegant, bohemian, modern, vintage, edgy, romantic
  - Pose requirements based on jewelry category and user preferences
  - Setting/environment: Studio, outdoor, home, office, special event
  - Lighting preferences: Natural, dramatic, soft, professional
  - User's specific aesthetic goals or inspiration references
  
  CONTEXT-DRIVEN JEWELRY PROMPT GENERATION:
  Extract and use from user request:
  - Exact jewelry descriptions, brand references, style inspirations
  - Material specifications: Metal types, gemstones, finishes, textures
  - Size and fit requirements: Dimensions, weight preferences, comfort factors
  - Occasion context: Wedding, everyday wear, formal events, gift-giving, professional settings
  - Personal significance: Symbolic meaning, cultural relevance, emotional connection
  - Technical details: Settings, clasps, movement types (for watches), certification requirements
